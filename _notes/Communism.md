As defined by [[Karl Marx]] in the [[Communist Manifesto]], the main goal of the Communist party is to represent the wants and common interests of the entire proletariat, independent of all nationality. 

The communist party is the most advanced and resolute section of the working class parties of every country. They clearly see the finish line - keeping at heart the goals of the proletarian movement. 

Their aims are in three parts: 
1. formation of the proletariat into a class, 
2. overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy,
3. and conquest of political power by the proletariat. 

*See the [[Communist Revolution]]*


> [!NOTE] The abolition of existing property relations is not at all a distinctive feature of communism.

As conditions in society change, so do the people's relations to property. [[The French Revolution]], for example abolished [[Feudal]] property in favour of bourgeois property. 

Main philosophy behind communism is the abolition of bourgeois property, which the the most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products, which is then based on the exploitation of the many by the few. 


> [!NOTE] In short, the theory of Communists can be summed up in a single sentence: Abolition of PRIVATE property.


In a bourgeois society, living labour is only needed to increase accumlated labour. In a communist society, accumlated labor is used to promote and enrich the existence of the laborer. 

Communists also aim to abolition bourgeois independence, individuality and freedom. Meaning the abolishment of the bourgeois conditions of production, free trade, free selling and buying. 

Private property in current society only exists becuase it doesn't exist for others. 

When individual property can no longer be transformed into bourgeois property, or [[Capital]], then individuality vanishes. 

> [!NOTE]
> Communism wants to deprive man of the power to subjugate the labor of others by appropriating the products of society.


Below are some additional tenets or platforms of communism:
1. Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes.  
2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.  
3. Abolition of all rights of inheritance.  
4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.  
5. Centralization of credit in the hands of the state, by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly.  
6. Centralization of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State.  
7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State; the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan.  
8. Equal liability of all to work. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.  
9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual abolition of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace over the country.  
10. Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of children’s factory labour in its present form. Combination of education with industrial production.

When class distinctions ***have*** disappeared, the want and need for political power loses character. Political power is simply organized power of one class oppressing another.

> [!question] 
> ***Why and how do Marx and Engels praise capitalism in this chapter one?***

Both Marx and Engels praise capitalism, rightfully so, because of it's ability in it's heyday, to advance society through quality of life and work improvements. It suppressed feudalism and represented the development of productive forces.
